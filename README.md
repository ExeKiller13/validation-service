# validation-service
***Task***

Write a WebService or jsp page. Users input their email address and password to get registered. Check legitimacy of the email and password.   
Regarding the password rules, please refer to Appleâ€™s password rules (It must satisfy all the following four terms.)
* It must include numbers, letters, uppercase and lowercase letters.
* It can only be visible symbols of ASCII
* The number of letters and numbers in a row must be smaller than 4.(e.g. both 1234 and dcba are not allowed)
* The number of same characters are no more than 3. (e.g. both aaaa and 0000 are not allowed) 

***Solution***

I've realized a Spring REST Service. It have a simple registration form.
My system validate password by different criteria. I used a regular expressions for checking strings.

Used technologies: Spring Framework, Spring MVC, JUnit.
